# BrowseIt

Additionally BrowseIt contains an introductory todolist, which both noobs and veterans will find useful. Try to check off everything in "the nooblist" to avoid forgetting something important.

## History

Version 2.0.0 included the awesome hangman game which lets employees play a game to learn each others names (match picture to name, hangman-style). The game was made by the new recruits Henrik Liodden and Levi Sørum.

The initial release of BrowseIt was made by Michael Johansen in July 2016. The extension was made with "research time" in "Web Chapter", a knowledge sharing community in Knowit Objectnet. It was created because Michael needed to prepare a talk about *Chrome extensions*, and what better way to prepare than to just make a Chrome extension? The extension is used by practically all new recruits as an onboarding tool.
